This film was recorded in Monterrey - Mexico with my rollerskates. Postproduction was done with Final Cut Pro X on a Macbook Pro 15.

This Film is Free As Beer ( If you are a FOSS Fan maybe you know what I mean :/ )

Maybe in the future I will be doing more Scenes of Monterrey (I have a lot of film recordings) but I have no time for post-production right now and I only will be doing it using FOSS (Free Open Source Software).
